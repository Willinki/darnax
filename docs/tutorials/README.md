# Tutorials

This section provides useful tutorial to get started using this library,
from JAX and Equinox basics to a first functioning example of a classifier on Entangled-MNIST.

Models and concepts from this library are based on the paper by [Badalotti, Baldassi, MÃ©zard, Scardecchia and Zecchina](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041v1).
On the final tutorial, we will be reproducing their result on the Entangled-MNIST dataset.

The purpose of this library, however, is more general, as it allows for the quick and intuitive implementation of diverse architectures and learning
schemes, loosely based on the principles of the original model.

See the first tutorial to get started.
