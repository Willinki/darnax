"""State interfaces.

This module defines the abstract :class:`State` contract used by orchestrators
and layer maps. A concrete state holds per-layer tensors plus two special
slots:

- index ``0``: **input** (provided by the caller),
- last index: **output** (produced by the network).

Implementations must be Equinox ``Module``s (i.e., PyTrees) and support
functional updates (returning **new** state instances rather than mutating
in place).

class State(eqx.Module):
    """Global state for a network (LayerMap).

    A ``State`` stores the tensors associated with each layer plus the
    designated **input** and **output** slots. The total number of elements
    must be **at least** ``#layers + 1`` (input + one per layer + output).

    Concretely, orchestrators assume:
    - ``state[0]`` holds the **input**,
    - ``state[-1]`` holds the **output**,
    - the remaining indices map to intermediate layer states according to the
      LayerMap’s ordering.

    Notes
    -----
    - ``State`` is an Equinox ``Module`` and thus a PyTree; it should be safe
      to pass through JAX transformations (``jit``, ``vmap``) as long as
      implementations avoid in-place mutation.
    - All mutating operations must be exposed as **functional** methods that
      return a *new* instance (see :meth:`replace` and :meth:`replace_val`).

    @abstractmethod
    def __getitem__(self, key: Any) -> Array:
        """Return the array stored at ``key``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : Any
            Index/key understood by the concrete implementation (commonly an
            ``int`` or a tuple).

        Returns
        -------
        Array
            The stored tensor for the given position.

        Notes
        -----
        Implementations should raise ``IndexError``/``KeyError`` on invalid
        positions, mirroring standard Python container semantics.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : Array
            Input tensor to place at index ``0``.
        y : Array or None, optional
            Optional target/output tensor to place at the last index. If
            ``None``, the output slot should be initialized according to the
            implementation’s policy (e.g., zeros or a placeholder).

        Returns
        -------
        Self
            A new state instance with input/output slots set.

        Notes
        -----
        This method must **not** mutate the receiver; it returns a new state
        object with the appropriate slots populated.

        Returns
        -------
        Self
            A new instance containing ``value`` as its storage.

        Notes
        -----
